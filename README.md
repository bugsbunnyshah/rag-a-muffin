Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) made powerful and simple

# Description

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) made powerful and simple. This project lets you connect a large language model to your own knowledge sources — documents, databases, APIs — so it can retrieve relevant facts before generating an answer. By separating retrieval (finding the right context) from generation (crafting the response), it produces more accurate, up-to-date, and transparent outputs than standalone LLMs. Built to be fast, modular, and easy to extend, it’s perfect for building chatbots, Q&A systems, research assistants, and any AI app that needs to “know what it’s talking about.”
